This is v2 of the epos control programs.  This now consists of a suite of programs
connected with ../linebusd to the 'ebus'.  The ebus protocol is of the form understood
by the eposcom programs:   

   serial:register[subregister]

   0xffff:0xaaaa[1]                interpreted by eposcom as a request to read register
   0xffff:0xaaaa[1] := value       interpreted by eposcom as a request to write register
   0xffff:0xaaaa[1] = value        emitted by eposcom to acknowledge read or write
   0xffff:0xaaaa[1] # error        emitted by eposcom in case of error reading or writing
   # comment line                  ignored by eposcom, can be used to encaps other messages        
  
and '#' lines (used to piggyback rudderctl messages from the lbus to the ebus

see start_rudderd.sh to see how the entire suite is to be run.
