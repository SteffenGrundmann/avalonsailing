= Introduction =

This document will go through the steps necessary to build and deploy
an image of the avalon sailing system.

= Details =

==Useful features of the avalon sailing build system:==
  * `make tarball`
    * Creates a tar.gz file of the current source
  * `make image [ IMAGE_DIR=/tmp/avalon ]`
    * runs buildroot/build.sh (optionally persisting the output in $(IMAGE_DIR)

==Steps to build an image:==
  * checkout the source code (or svn up if you already have it)
  * [#Prepare_CF Prepare] a CF card 
  * `make image`
  * mount CF somewhere
    * `mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt`
  * cp buildroot/out/vmlinuz /mnt
  * cp buildroot/out/rootfs.ext2.gz /mnt/initrd.img
  * `sync; umount /mnt`

==Prepare CF==
  * find out what device it appeared as (say /dev/sdb)
  * `apt-get install syslinux mbr`
  * make a VFAT filesystem on it
    * `fdisk /dev/sdb`
    * `mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sdb1`
  * `install-mbr /dev/sdb`
  * `syslinux /dev/sdb`
  * find a syslinux.cfg for it (if we haven't made one already)

==Quick Rebuild of persistent buildroot==
This is more complicated.  (to be completed)

  * `BUILDROOT=/tmp/avalon/buildroot-2011.05`
  * `cd $BUILDROOT`
  * `cd output/build/avalonsailing`
  * make whatever changes you want
  * invalidate the build stamps
    * `rm -rf .stamps/`
  * `cd $BUILDROOT`
  * make
