== 2011-02-28 ==

  * Lots of new people show up
  * Define license detail -> Freedom to open-sourcing granted
  * Keep software separate from mars-rover, internal stuff, etc.
  * Write code from scratch, except where already opensourced
  * Responsibilities:
     * alexeyn, wolfb: Planner

== 2011-03-07 ==

  * introduced a pdb avalon
  * boat in the lobby Tuesday night
  * Planner-Skipper interface not documented (sep. meeting setup by grundmann)
  * Skipper-Helmsman interface defined, to be documented by grundmann
  * Agreed on Alexey's proposal about units: all interfaces in knots, nautical miles, degrees. All angles in [0, 360)
  * Status updates:
    * Marius: Sat receiver can give rough (eps<12nm) position
    * Steffen: Polardiagram code ready
    * Wolf: ENC available (US for free, EU at reasonable cost)
    * Emma: Interface definitions (see above)
    * Bernhard: Power System Setup, meeting at ETH. The plan is to replace the main switch
    * all sensors deliver healthy flag, all process check in at different frequencies and report life status, Luuk proposes syslog lib.
    * Richard: NMEA libraries
  * Open items (push over to next meeting):
    * shall we switch on the AIS to improve collision avoidance?
    * Who gets the permissions to operat in the start and arrival countries?
    * Who is responsible for the insurance of damages of the boat to others?
