== 2011-02-21 ==

  * Students from ETH visit the Zurich office
  * General discussion as to how things could progress

== 2011-02-28 ==

  * Lots of new people show up
  * Define license detail -> Freedom to open-sourcing granted
  * Keep software separate from mars-rover, internal stuff, etc.
  * Write code from scratch, except where already opensourced
  * Responsibilities:
     * alexeyn, wolfb: Planner
     * emma: Skipper
     * grundmann: Helmsmann (Support: wolfb with sailing, marius)
     * code repository: uqs
     * watchdog & system reliability: bernhard
     * radio: Marius
     * sponsoring and HW 
     * electronic navigational charts (wolf)
     * sensorics: Richard
   * Get a bigger room (with VC) for next meeting

== 2011-03-07 ==

  * introduced a pdb avalon
  * boat in the lobby Tuesday night
  * Planner-Skipper interface not documented (sep. meeting setup by grundmann)
  * Skipper-Helmsman interface defined, to be documented by grundmann
  * Agreed on Alexey's proposal about units: all interfaces in knots, nautical miles, degrees. All angles in [0, 360)
  * Status updates:
    * Marius: Sat receiver can give rough (eps<12nm) position
    * Steffen: Polardiagram code ready
    * Wolf: ENC available (US for free, EU at reasonable cost)
    * Emma: Interface definitions (see above)
    * Bernhard: Power System Setup, meeting at ETH. The plan is to replace the main switch
    * all sensors deliver healthy flag, all process check in at different frequencies and report life status, Luuk proposes syslog lib.
    * Richard: NMEA libraries
  * Open items (push over to next meeting):
    * shall we switch on the AIS to improve collision avoidance?
    * Who gets the permissions to operat in the start and arrival countries?
    * Who is responsible for the insurance of damages of the boat to others?
    * Warning plate/flag
  * Source code discussions:
    * On the boat: only C/C++
    * Off the boat: whatever floats your boat
    * Proposed src tree layout
      * docs/
      * planner/
      * skipper/
      * helmsman/lib/`*`.{c,h,a}
      * io/rudder/
      * io/ais/
      * io/gps/, etc.
      * radio/ (perhaps under of io?)
    * No circular dependencies, skipper may depend on helmsman or io, but not the other way round
  * Please put docs either in doc/ or on the Wiki page (which will  then end up in SVN under the wiki/ directory)
  * We decided on using Rietveld for review, people should download 'upload.py' from http://codereview.appspot.com (and create an account)
  * AI(uqs): put checkout/build instructions on the Wiki
  * AI(lvd): put up the shopping list for discussion: https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/google.com/ccc?key=0AnVYj5ZguanKdDZ4VDhydjFwR3A3T3pjTzNzbHY3R2c&hl=en#gid=0
  * AI(lvd): ask professional legal input on the broadcast AIS issue.  Sent out mail to legal@.
  * AI(all): request commit access from uqs

  * Helmsman-Skipper interface (grundmann)

== 2011-03-28 ==
  * Rough test planning proposal
    * June 1: Hardware complete  
    * June 14: All software components complete
    * June 16-29: Everything put together
    * July 1-7: TestSeries1 Zurich lake
    * August 1-7: TestSeries2 on Zurich lake (or Lake Lucerne, depending on the wind)
    * End of August: Transport to Brest + test on ocean + Launch
    * September 1-4: Sail!
 
  * AI: get Iridium SIM card, open item, 900CHF 
  * AI: follow the idea of replacing the expensive iridium phone by something else for testing (lvd, marius)
  * Addendum: test commit from SVN done on 29.3.

== 2011-04-04 ==
  * new team members Hafez, William
  * grundmann, simulation code, many bugs in reports
  * marius: position (20 nm precision) from satellite phone
    * SIM card defunct, new costs 900CHF, marius takes care of that now. 
    * Marius send encode SMS code for review
  * wind, compass
    * Wolf: Is the compass calibrated? (interference with on board electronics possible)
  * Wolf started download of 90m grid data
    * buy navigational charts 100 Euro for british channel charts (IHO format)
    * we have weather and current maps
    * plus US coastal maps
    * Task: check in the maps in a known format (Wolf) 
    * Task: buy charts (Wolf)
    * Get 100 Euro (Piet)
  * Logistics: William offered help
  * Richard: Was on military leave,
    * sent code for NMEA processor
    * can start on the non-NMEA sensors, access from tomorrow
  * Map code in Panner review
    * basically ok, but some doubt about proof of correctnes.
    * Alexej and lvd continue on improvements
  * Modem cable and connection
  * Deadlines precision beta version of helmsman at the end of April
  * Bernhard: Reviews 
  * Adam switch bought, LVD (cut-off at 20V) ordered timing delay relais
    * Financing by Piet
  * lvd expenses: (250 for power supply, 50 cable, 8.90 gender changer)

== 2011-04-11 ==
  * lvd: boat connected, ssh works (rowyourboat) search valentine for that,
    * 2 accounts: rower pw then ssh to boat: 2 logins: root and castor
    * No Go on the boat.
    * lvd will be gone for 3 weeks, spending authority delegated to Pete
    * some money (Sim card ok)
  * liam building images 
  * Richard: submitted NeMEA code, almost works, get no dat for now. tried wind sensor, IMU should work
    * Bernhard : something happening during start-up, Edge port?  Richard will clarify, 
    * Kendy looks into Epos library for drive interface. (The protocol is documented)
  * Wolf: no big updates, made a script, less than 3m depth is forbidden, 
    * will be away for 6 weeks after next week
 * Steffen: Simulation code, aerodynamics and boat geometry done
 * Bernhard: sent some code for review, lab work, ordered a RS323-485 converter,
    * code of the process manager
  * Marius: Play with the sim card, send SMS code, in C
    *found documentation page describing the function, will send an SMS soon.
  * Wolf: would be good to have a map application, fusion table -> map with current SMS info.
      * share position in Latitude ? Just reuse the message format. XMPP ?
      * Or sent everything to twitter.
  * Wojciech:
     * optimal_angle = f(position) is the world for skipper
     *  small obstacles (buoys, drilling platforms) generalize to a 10-50 mile island
  * AI: Arriving point ? lvd talks to ETH
  * Wojciech: started drafting a design
     * loop woken by alarm or fixed time
  * AI: Steffen: current true wind input format average over last 15-60 minutes. Plus boat speed  
  * Averaging the wind in the sensor task
  * Get raw 3D position parallel to filteres sensor-fusioned data.

== 2011-04-18 ==
  * Marius
  - Did some testing of the system by sending a text message

  * Alexey
  - finally done with source data, has depth map, has wind and tides
  - tides. best to do in the collision avoider, no best to do in the global planner
  - what about just lowering the ocean by 3M such that any points that we could run into look like islands
  - global planner is digital now

  * Testing
  - Would be good to put it in the garden for a couple of days and monitor battery life and wear
  - Lake Geneva might be good
  - Would be good to do an atlantic test with some amount of time
  - Need to bear in mind the budget
  - Come back to this when Luke is here and need to discuss with the ETH guys

  * Emma
  - Will schedule a monthly social with ETH
  - Poster, need a team photo. Emma will schedule some time to take the photo this week.
AI(Emma): Schedule some time to take picture on Wednesday

  * Wolf
  - working on the map data
  - will make shipping lanes no go zones

  * Richard
  - sensor cable
  - looked at IMU protocol

  * Bernhard
  - bunch of useful utilities, communication
  - wrote a buffered I/O (because the standard way didn't seem to be safe)

  * Steffen
  - Finished the first model of the boat with sails and rudder and everything
  - Doing it in octave (Open Source version of matlab)
  - Going to test and debug it now
