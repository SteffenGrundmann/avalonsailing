This is v2 of the epos control programs.  This now consists of a suite of programs
connected with ../linebusd to the 'ebus'.  The ebus protocol is of the form understood
by the eposcom programs:   

   serial:register[subregister]

   0xffff:0xaaaa[1]                interpreted by eposcom as a request to read register
   0xffff:0xaaaa[1] := value       interpreted by eposcom as a request to write register
   0xffff:0xaaaa[1] = value        emitted by eposcom to acknowledge read or write
   0xffff:0xaaaa[1] # error        emitted by eposcom in case of error reading or writing

with the -T flag, eposcom and others will add a trailing T:us field with the current timestamp at the moment
of sending the message.

see start_rudderd.sh to see how the entire suite is to be run.
