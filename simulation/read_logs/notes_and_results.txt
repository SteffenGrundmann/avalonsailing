Sampling time
=============
Test started at: Fri May 22 16:46:42 2009

Usually T = 60ms (16.67 Hz)
min 50ms
max 1.0768s
Big spikes (3 times more than 1 s within 20000 samples, 3 times double T)

Location
========

On Lake Uri (Urnersee, southern end of Lake Lucerne)
start east of Isleten, in the middle of the lake.
lat_0 =  46.920
lon_0 =  8.6068
North: 046deg 55min 10.675sec
East:  008deg 36min 24.599sec


Wind
====
The wind comes from north west.
According to

The weather in Altdorf was as follows:

22 Mai,
        hour  째C    mmHg  mmHg@sealevel  rH/% wind direction  *   **  clouds        
Freitag	23	  19.5	725.7	763.6	         73	  NW	            0	 	17	100%.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	1500-2000	 	 	18.0	14.5	 	 	 	 	 
        17	  22.8	723.8	761.1	         59	  NNW	            5	 	18	50%.	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	2000-2500	 	 	20.0	14.4	 	 	 	 	 

"* average over 2 minutes, in 10-12m hight in m/s
** peak wind speed, in m/s

Sisikon
        17	  9.5	  595.3	 	             98	  S	              2	 	23	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	9.2	

So the wind data for Altdorf and sisikon contradict each other. In any case the
wind at the lake will differ from the wind at the measurement stations.

The wind direction from NW fits to the terrain profile.
For the average wind strength we may assume anything from 2 - 8 m/s.




Moving direction
================
% N until 120s, heel +9째 to starboard
% W until 650s, heel -6째
% N (E) until 1000s, heel +6째 
% omega turn to west
% N until 1200s


Height
======

max error over 20 minutes: +- 10m
Real value is const +- 0.25m.
No correlation with other data
stddev = 3.5m
Conclusion: Error (stddev) of x and y in the same range.


phi_y less than 2 degree (unbelievable, was rad/deg problem in ETH SW)
So in reality it was 

omega_z
=======

The yaw rate can easily be +- 15 degrees/s .
The yaw rate in the logs was in rad/s and had the opposite sign to phi_z!
phi_z and the integrated om_z match (within 3 degrees over 20 s).

turning by 40 degrees took e.g. 2s. 



Heel
====

best calculated from acceleration acc_y and acc_z.
E.g. first 100s: -9 degrees (acc_z 0 -9.8/s) 

Note z-axis shows up (Avalon convention is down).

So we measure a acc_z around -9.8m/s^2 all the time.
y-axis goes to starboard, so a positive acc_y means heel to the right/starboard
and a positive phi_x.
phi_x_from_acc = -rad2deg * atan2(acc_y, -acc_z);




|phi_y| is smaller than 2 degrees.
